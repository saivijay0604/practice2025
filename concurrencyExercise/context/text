// Context is immutable
//context package provides function to derive neww context values from existing ones to add cancellation bahaviour

// 1.	context.WithCancel() - is used to create a cancellation
//            cancel() - is used to close the done channel
//            On receving the close signal, goroutine is suppose to abandon its operation and return.

//2.    context.WithDeadline() - is used to set deadline to an operation
//            Creates a new context whose done channel gets clised when machine's clock advances past the given deadline
//            ctx.Deadline() -  can used to know if a deadline is associated with the context

//3.    context.WithTimeoute() - used to set timeout to an operation
//             creates a new context whose done channel is closed after the given timeout duration.

//context pacakge can used as data bag to carry request scoped dataa

//4.    context.WithValue() - used to associate request- scoped data with a context
//				ctx.Values() - is used to extract the value given a key from the context
